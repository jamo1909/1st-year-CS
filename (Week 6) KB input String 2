/*
Write a Java program that checks if a user inputted String starts with a 'T' and ends with a 'd'.

If the String starts and ends with a 'T' and 'd' respectively then print to the screen: 
"This String starts with T and ends with d"

If the String starts with a 'T' and doesn't end with 'd' then print to the screen:
"This String starts with T"

If the String doesn't start with a 'T' but ends with 'd' then print to the screen:
"This String ends with d"

Otherwise print to the screen: "This String DOES NOT start with T or end with d"
