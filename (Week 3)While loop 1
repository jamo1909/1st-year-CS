/*
Write a Java program that uses a while loop to find the factorial of a number. Declare an integer variable called num. 
Factorial is the result of multiplying a sequence of natural numbers down to 1.
Examples of this are:
4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24
7! = 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 5040

        int num = 7;
        int total = 1;
        int count = 1;
        
        while (count <= num)
        {
            total = total*count;
            count ++;
        }
