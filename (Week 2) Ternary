/*
Write a Java program that prints out the fee to use a golf course depending on whether the user is a member or not. If the user is a member
the fee is 5 and if not the fee is 20. 

You must use the ternary operator. 

A variable of type char called member should have the value 'Y' or 'N' which decides if the user is a member or not. 
An integer called fee holds the the fee given from the ternary operator. Evaluate with member = 'N'.
